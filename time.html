  <h1>üï∞ What is Time?</h1>
  <p class="quote">"Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so." ‚Äì Douglas Adams</p>
  <p>
    Time is one of the most fundamental concepts in physics, yet it's also one of the most mysterious.
    Is it a dimension? An illusion? A flowing river? In Einstein's relativity, time is flexible and affected by speed and gravity.
    In quantum physics, time behaves very differently ‚Äî and may not even be fundamental.
